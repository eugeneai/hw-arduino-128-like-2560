# Irk-stud-duino (Arduino like) board to arrange studying Real-time systems.

Printed circuit design for Arduino-like board, allowing students to study microcontrollers with less soldering.

*ATTENTION! This PCB Design is not complete, e.g., it is not pin-compatible with Arduino Mega.**

##TODO:

- Move big components on the top of PCB (swap sides).
- Add an N-P-N transistor in key mode with some components to connect output of 7555, __e.g.__, with a relay.
- Move silk text to a visible place.
- Use SMD Capacitors around 5V rectifier.
